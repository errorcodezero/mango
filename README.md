A fresh take on programming.

## Get started

Prerequisites:
- C++23 Compiler(gcc and clang work)
- GNU Make

Compile the code with `make release`.
It should then create a new directory
called build with the executable inside
it. Path should be `./build/mango`.

## Features

Coming soon!

- Order of Operations ✅
- Print Statements ✅
- Variables (kinda)
- Functions ❌
- Classes ❌
- Turing Complete ❌

## Usage

Takes argument of a file path. For example `./build/mango ./examples/showcase/main.mango`

## How To Write

It's a basic C-like language meaning it follows conventions
you're likely already familiar with. Lines end with semi-colons,
we use braces, etc.

Operators are the same as they are in C as well. Keywords include:
    - `let` declares a variable in a typical C-like fashion.
    - `print` prints out something to standard output.
